<B>Overview</b>
<p>In this project, work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. 
Look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time seriesmodel to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.
<p>Some of the things to learn in this project are:<br>

->How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.<br>
->How to prepare time series data for analysis.<br>
->How to build an autoregression model.<br>
->How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.<br>
->Time series models are not only important in public health; they're a key part of Financial Engineering. 
Plus, concepts learned in this project will be helpful in Natural Language Processing.
